Hereâ€™s the modified full code with the ability to upload images using google.colab:

Full Code for Google Colab

# Step 1: Clone the repository and install dependencies
!git clone https://github.com/OpenBMB/MiniCPM-V.git
%cd MiniCPM-V

# Install required dependencies
!pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Import necessary libraries
import torch
from PIL import Image
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
from google.colab import files

# Step 3: Upload images
# Use this block to upload the images to Colab
print("Please upload your image files (e.g., image1.jpg, image2.jpg):")
uploaded = files.upload()

# Rename the uploaded files to standard names for easier reference
import os
os.rename(list(uploaded.keys())[0], "image1.jpg")
os.rename(list(uploaded.keys())[1], "image2.jpg")

# Step 4: Load the model and tokenizer
# Load the MiniCPM-V model
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    'openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2.6',
    trust_remote_code=True,
    attn_implementation='sdpa',
    torch_dtype=torch.float16  # Using float16 for better efficiency
)
model = model.eval().cuda()  # Set to evaluation mode and load to GPU if available

# Load the tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    'openbmb/MiniCPM-V-2.6',
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Step 5: Prepare the images
# Load and preprocess images
image1 = Image.open('image1.jpg').convert('RGB')
image2 = Image.open('image2.jpg').convert('RGB')

# Step 6: Formulate the query
# Define the user question
question = "Compare image 1 and image 2, tell me about the differences between image 1 and image 2."

# Create the input message for the model
msgs = [
    {'role': 'user', 'content': [image1, image2, question]}
]

# Step 7: Generate the answer
# Pass the images and question to the model
answer = model.chat(
    image=None,  # Set to None because images are passed in the content
    msgs=msgs,
    tokenizer=tokenizer
)

# Print the generated response
print("Model's Response:")
print(answer)

Execution Instructions

	1.	Copy and paste the code into a Google Colab notebook.
	2.	Run each cell step by step.
	3.	When prompted to upload images, upload two image files.
	4.	The model will analyze the images and provide a comparison in the output.
